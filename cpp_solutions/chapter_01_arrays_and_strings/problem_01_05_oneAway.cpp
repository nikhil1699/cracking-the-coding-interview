Chapter 01 - Problem 05 - One Away - CTCI 6th Edition page 91

Problem Statement:
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

Example:
pale, ple -> true
pales, pale -> true
pale, bale -> true
pale, bae -> false

Solution:
1. If the strings differ in length by more than 1 character, return false.

2. If two strings differ in length by exactly one character, then search for an insertion / removal.
Traverse each string until a difference is found. If a difference is found, advance the index of the
        longer string by 1 and the index of the shorter string by 0. If another difference is found, return false.
If no other difference is found, return true.

3. If the strings have the same length, search for a replacement: traverse each string counting differences.
If more than one difference is found, return false else return true.

Time complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the shorter string.
Space complexity: O(1)
